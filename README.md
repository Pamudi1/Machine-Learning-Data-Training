## Training and Testing Data Split (80/20 Rule)

In machine learning, it is crucial to evaluate the model's performance on data it has not seen before. To achieve this, we typically divide the dataset into two main parts:           training data and test data. 

The 80/20 split is a commonly used ratio, where:   
    80% of the data is used for training the model.
    20% of the data is set aside as the test data for evaluation.

This division helps ensure that the model is not overfitting to the data it was trained on, and it can generalize well to unseen data.
